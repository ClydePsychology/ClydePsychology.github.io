# About Me

<img src="https://clydepsychology.github.io/clyde.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Jincheng Wu (Clyde Wu)**.<br>

I am a graduate student studying in [**Interdisplinary Studies in Human Development M.S.Ed Program**](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/interdisciplinary-studies-human-development-msed) at University of Pennsylvania. My program focus on examining the social, emotional, cognitive, and physical aspects of human development within the context of culture and social policy.

My research interests broadly lie in the area of young individual’s **socio-emotional development**. Particularly, my research focuses on understanding how **individual factors** (e.g., temperament, resilience, theory of Mind)
 and **environmental factors** (e.g., parenting styles, school education, culture) influence the children’s socio-emotional development (e.g., Peer Preference, Emotion Understanding). 

During my research, I would like to take the **perspective of culture and family** when studying of child development. In the future, I would like to study more about the children’s socio-emotional development 
and the real-world practice (interventions based on my research) will also be carried out.

Before my graduate study, I received my B.S. in Applied Psychology at Zhejiang University of Technology (China) under the guidance of [Assoc.Prof. Yulong Tang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yulong-Tang-4) and [Dr. Shuyi Zhai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=1U_lN9YAAAAJ). 
I was also a visiting student at University of California, Berkeley in 2024 Spring.

During my undergraduate studies, I was a research assistant at [**Zhou Family & Culture Lab**](https://zhoulab.berkeley.edu/) in UC berkeley and [**Life-span Development Laboratory**](https://lifespan.stanford.edu/)  in Stanford University.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at — **clydewu [at] upenn.edu**
