# About Me

<img src="https://clydepsychology.github.io/clyde.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Jincheng Wu (Clyde, 吴锦程)**.<br>

I am a graduate student studying in Interdisplinary Studies in Human Development M.S.Ed Program at University of Pennsylvania, supervised by [Prof. Xinyin Chen](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/faculty/xinyin-chen).

My research interests broadly lie in the area of young individual’s socio-emotional development. Particularly, my research focuses on understanding how individual factors (e.g., temperament, resilience, theory of Mind)
 and environmental factors (e.g., parenting styles, school education, culture) influence the children’s socio-emotional development (e.g., Peer Preference, Emotion Understanding). 

During my research, I would like to take the perspective of culture and family when it comes to the study of child development. In the future, I would like to research more about the children’s socio-emotional development 
and the real-world practice (interventions based on my research) will also be carried out.

Before my graduate study, I received my B.S. in Applied Psychology at Zhejiang University of Technology (China) under the guidance of [Assoc.Prof. Yulong Tang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yulong-Tang-4) and [Dr. Shuyi Zhai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=1U_lN9YAAAAJ). 
I was also a visiting student at University of California, Berkeley in 2024 Spring.

During my undergraduate studies, I was a research assistant at Zhou Family & Culture Lab in UC berkeley and Life-span Development Laboratory in Stanford University.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at — **clydewu [at] upenn.edu**
