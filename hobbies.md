<br> I enjoyed listening to music, playing guitar and singing songs. 
From 2021 to 2023, I attended the Top 10 singers Competitions in my college every year and achieved the excellent result of ranking among the top three each time.
In 2024, I was invited to be a judge for the Top 10 Singers Competition in my college, providing advice and guidance to students.

## Hiking

<br> I love hiking with friends. During my college, I went hiking at least twice each month. Hangzhou has many beautiful hiking trials and they helps to release a lof of stress on me!!
